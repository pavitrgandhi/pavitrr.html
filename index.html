<h2>how i like my things:</h2>
<p>There was a boy named Leo, <br>who spent most of his afternoons by the old oak tree,<br>at the edge of the meadow, lost in the pages of his favorite adventure novels. His imagination soared far beyond the small town he called home, transporting him to jungles filled with hidden treasure and deserts where ancient secrets lay buried beneath the sands. Though his friends often ran off to play soccer or chase each other through the streets, Leo preferred the company of stories and the soft rustle of leaves in the wind. He dreamt of faraway lands, but deep down, he knew his heart belonged to the quiet corners of the world where the impossible felt just within reach.
